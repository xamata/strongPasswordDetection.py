# strongPasswordDetection.py
Input a password into a function and validate if that password is strong enough using regular expressions.

This one worked very smoothly, I began with the gameplan and rather than having to bandaid errors while implementing code, I was able to determine a new path and completely repair my path before even starting! It was a life saver as the path I took seperating the regex's before entering a loop made the code much, much cleaner. I am happy with the result and happy with amount of time spent on this one, efficient and effective!
